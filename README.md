## Exercises

- **HW1** (Image Fundamentals)([See full details](./HW1/README.md))
- **HW2** (Contrast adjustment) ([See full details](./HW2/README.md))  
- **HW3** (Filters) ([See full details](./HW3/README.md))

- You can find the full exercises in `Homework.pdf`.


## Requirements
The exercises run in Google Colab and require the following libraries:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- PyWavelets


## Setup and Installation
No installation is required if you're using Google Colab. However, if running locally, install the dependencies and run the Python codes in notebooks.

## Running the Exercises
To run each exercise, navigate to the appropriate directory, open the corresponding Colab notebook, and simply click on the notebook link provided in the notebook file, and it will open in Colab.
