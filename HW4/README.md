# Frequency Domain

## Overview
This exercise focuses on applying the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to perform linear convolution and frequency domain filtering on grayscale images.

## Exercise Content

#### 4.2.1. Linear Convolution using DFT
- **Step 1**: Use the DFT function to compute the linear convolution of a 256 √ó 256 image with an 11 √ó 11 filter.
- **Step 2**: Explain the required DFT size to achieve convolution.
- **Step 3**: Analyze the convolution output and determine for which values of (ùëö, ùëõ) the result matches the expected output.

#### 4.2.2. Frequency Domain Filtering
- **Step 1**: Perform a 2D DFT on the grayscale Barbara image.
- **Step 2**: Zero out specific DFT coefficients for low-pass filtering with thresholds ùëá = 1/4 and ùëá = 1/8.
- **Step 3**: Apply custom filters by zeroing out coefficients in different frequency regions.
- **Step 4**: Perform inverse DFT to obtain the filtered image, and display the original and filtered images.
